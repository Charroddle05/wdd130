      <p>Hello! My name is Charlotte Acosta and I am from Denver, Colorado. I love animals, I have three cats and a dog.
      I also love gaming, I've been obsessed with fortnite. In my free time I like to do digital art and play songs on my

      <p>Colorado is a state in the western region of the United States. It is bordered by Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma, 
      Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming. The Rocky Mountains cover most of the western part of the state and they stretch 
      from New Mexico into Canada. These moutains are home to wildlife such as bighorn sheep, mountain goats, black bears,
      mountain lions and beavers. Colorado is home to many native trees like the ponderosa pine. They're evergreen trees with needles and pine cones and the bark smells like vanilla or butterscotch. Denver is the state capital and the largest city, with 300 days of sunshine, mild winters and comfortable summers. </p>
